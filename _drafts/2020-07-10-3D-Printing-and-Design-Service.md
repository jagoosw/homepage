Recently I've been gaining a lot of experiance with 3D design and printing. I've designed and printed several items for clients and am always looking for more work so please contact me if you have anything that needs designing or printing (or both), I'd be very happy to help. Below are a selection of items I've designed recently.
### Mechanical parts for a plastic recycler I'm designing (more to follow)
